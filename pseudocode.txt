# Pseudo-code
## Mostly Im writing this to restructure

1 - make an html and css code with all the plugins and scripts attached
2 - give it a nav bar w a logo in one div, and fake ul links on the other, split page look
3 - js for landing modal
4 - html and css for datepicker, guest input and search button
5 - create all the item data, in separate data.js to be organised
6 - make guests buttons work
7 - make datepicker work
8 - create and run function to display all items
    - modal overlaying it?
9 - create function to hide NOTresults
9 - function to filter and hide everything else
    - event listener on search button
    - get inputs (guests, dates > diff > total days)
    - get NOTresults from:
    - parseInt for max and min guests and days
    - return inputs guests and total days if theyre NOT within min/max guests and dates
    - run function to hide NOTresults
function NOTresults
